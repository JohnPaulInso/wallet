# 🔧 CRITICAL: Enable Google Sign-In in Firebase

## ⚠️ Why Sign-In Isn't Working

Your code is correct, but **Google Sign-In is not enabled** in your Firebase project. You need to enable it in Firebase Console.

## 🚀 Quick Fix (2 minutes)

### Step 1: Enable Google Authentication

1. **Open Firebase Console Authentication**:

   ```
   https://console.firebase.google.com/project/atome-wallet/authentication/providers
   ```

2. **Click on "Google" in the Sign-in providers list**

3. **Toggle "Enable" to ON**

4. **Add your OAuth Client ID**:

   - Project support email: (select your email)
   - Web SDK configuration:
     - Web client ID: `64186651619-3eb9ki680f4c8q2g2mese3c8hhfur23b.apps.googleusercontent.com`
     - Web client secret: (get this from Google Cloud Console)

5. **Click "Save"**

### Step 2: Get Web Client Secret

1. **Go to Google Cloud Credentials**:

   ```
   https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials?project=atome-wallet
   ```

2. **Click on your OAuth client**: `SmartWallet Web Client`

3. **Copy the "Client secret"** (it's shown next to Client ID)

4. **Go back to Firebase** and paste it in the "Web client secret" field

5. **Click "Save"**

### Step 3: Add Authorized Domain

1. **In Firebase Console, go to Authentication → Settings**:

   ```
   https://console.firebase.google.com/project/atome-wallet/authentication/settings
   ```

2. **Scroll to "Authorized domains"**

3. **Click "Add domain"**

4. **Add**: `localhost`

5. **Click "Add"**

4. **You should see**:
   - Console log: "Sign in button clicked"
   - Console log: "Starting sign in with popup..."
   - Google sign-in popup window opens
